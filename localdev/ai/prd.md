1. Project Overview
The AI Coding Assistant aims to facilitate the development of a Schema.org-based Content Management System (CMS) that allows non-technical users to create and host websites effortlessly. The assistant will generate code for backend and frontend components, ensuring SEO-friendly content with structured data in JSON-LD format.

2. Target Users
- Primary users: Non-technical individuals (beginners) who lack knowledge of database installation or programming languages.
- User needs: Authors should be able to create model types and create content by using a simple Admin interface. Users should be able to browse contents by using a customizable web page.

3. Key Features
- Code Suggestions: Contextual code snippets for Golang, HTMX, and JavaScript.
- Documentation Generation: Auto-generate relevant documentation based on user input and generated code.
- HTML and Frontend Code Generation: Create responsive and SEO-friendly front-end templates automatically.
- Backend Code and Test Generation: Generate secure and efficient backend code with associated tests.

4. Supported Technologies
- Programming Languages: Golang, HTMX, JavaScript.
- Database: SQLite (default).
- Deployment: Executable that can run on low-resource hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero, Android phones).

5. Integration
- Development Environments: Primarily support NeoVim with Avante, while also ensuring compatibility with other popular editors and AI coding assistants.

6. Decision-Making Criteria
- Code Quality: Focus on readability and adherence to best practices.
- Security: Prioritize security measures to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Commenting: Provide comments only for complex code sections, ensuring clarity without excessive verbosity.

7. Learning and Improvement
- Feedback Mechanism: Incorporate user feedback and code reviews to enhance the assistantâ€™s learning capabilities and improve future code suggestions.

8. User Interaction
- Interface: Primarily through a chat interface, with inline code suggestions and visual prompts integrated into the development environment.

9. Success Metrics
- Accuracy of Code Suggestions: Measure the relevance and correctness of code generated.
- Learning Efficiency: Track the assistant's ability to learn from user interactions and improve over time.
- Time Savings: Evaluate how much time users save by receiving complete file or method suggestions with minimal changes.

10. Timeline and Milestones
- Timeline: No specific timeline set. Future milestones to be determined based on project progress and feedback.
